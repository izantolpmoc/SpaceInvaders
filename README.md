# Shoot Dat Cube - SpaceInvaders

## Game rules:

You start the game with a spaceship in the middle of the screen. 
A bunch of pink innocent alien cubes will progressively appear on your screen. They all have the same size but rotate in a unique way. 
These cubes cannot harm you, but *you* can. Actually, your goal is to destroy every cube on the screen.

The only thing you can lose in that game is your patience, your sanity or your time. In other words, Victory is assured!

The cubes will become agitated and move increasingly faster as the game goes on, but they can never escape the frame of your window.

## Directions
<kbd>&larr;</kbd> arrow key left will make your spaceship move the the left

<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> arrow key right will make your spaceship move the the right

<kbd>Space</kbd> will make your spaceship shoot a projectile towards the cubes


Good luck !
